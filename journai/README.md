This project is a journey planner which takes a user's start destination, end destination and one point of interest which will generate a stop along the way. 

## Description

This project uses the power of AI to give a user a unique journey based upon the point of interest they have entered. There are three external API's utilised to build this app.
1.OpenAI API 
2.MapBox Directions API 
3.Google Maps Geocoding API 
The languages included in this project are ThymeLeaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java.

## Features
-Taking a user's interest.
-Generating a stop based on the interest entered and the KM distance from the route. 
-Using OpenAI API to generate the route.
-Using GoogleMaps API to get coordinates for each point of the route.
-Using MapBox API to visually represent the route on a map.

## What I Learned 
1. Using external API's - I had never used external API's prior to building this project 
2. Prompt Engineering - Being able to wrap and send a prompt but also to manipulate the response
